# Bank-Customer-Attrition

## Overview
This project aims to identify customers who are likely to churn (leave the bank) by analyzing their behavior and demographic attributes. Using machine learning, the model helps in predicting attrition and allows the bank to take proactive retention measures.

## Dataset
**File name**: `Bank-Customer-Attrition-Insights-Data.csv` .

**Description** :The dataset contains 1,000 rows and 14 attributes. Each row represents a customer, and the attributes include various demographic and account-related features.

1. `Geographic Loaction`
2. `Gender`
3. `CreditCard User`
4. `Balance`
   
## Project Objective
- Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn.
- Build a prediction model that will:
- Classify if a customer is going to churn or not.
- Attach a probability to the churn, helping customer service target efforts effectively.
